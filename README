This code handles reCaptcha (http://www.google.com/recaptcha) form
submissions in Python.

Set the recaptcha_private_key variable to the one provided for your
domain, and call:

    confirm (client_ip_address, recaptcha_challenge_field,
    recaptcha_response_field)

Which returns either True (i.e., the captcha was completed correctly)
or False.

The client_ip_address, recaptcha_challenge_field, recaptcha_response_field
fields are provided by parsing the results of POSTing the form (e.g.,
using a web server module like mod_python, mod_wsgi, or FastCGI).
